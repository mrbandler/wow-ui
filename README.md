> ⚠️ The respository currently holds configurations for my specific characters, I am working on removing them from the repo for better compatibility.

## 1. Installation

> ℹ️ For the easiest installation experience it is recommended to clone the repository in your World of Warcraft installation directory.

```powershell
> git clone https://github.com/mrbandler/wow-ui.git

OR

> git clone git@github.com:mrbandler/wow-ui.git
```

After the cloning process is finished move into the cloned repository directory and execute the following command:

```powershell
> ./install.ps1
```

> ℹ️ If you didn't clone into your World of Warcraft installation directory use the scripts parameters.

```powershell
> ./install.ps1 -addons "C:\ProgramFiles(x86)\WorldofWarcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns" -wtf "C:\ProgramFiles(x86)\WorldofWarcraft\_retail_\WTF"
```

Don't worry the script is non-distructive, it creates a backup of you current configurations and addons to easily move back to your previous UI.
